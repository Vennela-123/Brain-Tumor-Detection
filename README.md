Brain Tumor Detection using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm:
This repository contains the code and resources for a brain tumor detection project using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python. The project aims to classify brain MRI images into two categories: tumor-present and tumor-absent.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project consists of brain MRI images. It is divided into two classes: images with brain tumors and images without brain tumors.

Requirements:
Python 
NumPy 
OpenCV 
Scikit-learn 
Matplotlib 

Results:
The KNN algorithm achieves an accuracy of 98% on the brain tumor detection task using the provided dataset. This accuracy may vary depending on the dataset used and the chosen parameters for the KNN algorithm.
